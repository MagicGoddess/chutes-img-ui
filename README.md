# Chutes Image UI

A minimalist, vibecoded Progressive Web App for generating and editing images with Chutes. Runs fully client-side in your browser; only your selected source image or prompt is sent to Chutes, and your API key is stored in localStorage.

## Features
- Clean single-page UI; desktop two-column layout (Input | Result)
- Supports two modes: Image Edit and Text-to-Image generation
- Model selector for Text-to-Image with multiple models (e.g., Hidream, JuggernautXL, Chroma, Wan2.1 14b)
- **Smart Parameter Management**: Auto resolution preset, empty fields use model defaults, settings preserved when switching models. Models like Wan2.1 14b use a fixed set of supported resolutions.
- **Image History**: Automatically saves generated images with full metadata
  - **Collapsible Activity Log**: Clean, space-saving interface (collapsed by default)
  - **Grid View**: Visual gallery of all generated images with model and settings preview
  - **Modal Preview**: Full-size image viewer with metadata display
  - **Settings Restoration**: Click any image to restore its exact generation settings
  - **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple images for batch deletion
  - **Smart Storage**: Keeps last 50 images, includes source images for edits
- Quota counter: Displays remaining quota as a percentage and usage details
- Experimental PWA: installable, offline app-shell cache
- Activity log for quick debugging and status
- Copies output to clipboard and allows download
- No server code; pure static files

## Configure
- Chutes API key is stored in `localStorage['chutes_api_key']`.
- Quota usage endpoint: `GET https://api.chutes.ai/users/me/quota_usage/me`
- API endpoints:
  - Image Edit: `POST https://chutes-qwen-image-edit.chutes.ai/generate`
  - Text-to-Image: `POST https://image.chutes.ai/generate` with `model` parameter
  - Wan2.1 14b: `POST https://chutes-wan2-1-14b.chutes.ai/text2image` (uses `resolution` enum, not width/height)
- Request body (flat):
  - Image Edit: `width`, `height`, `prompt`, `image_b64`, `true_cfg_scale`, `num_inference_steps`, optionally `negative_prompt`, `seed`.
  - **Send to Image Edit**: One-click button on result and in modal to use an image as the source for Image Edit
  - Text-to-Image: `width`, `height`, `prompt`, `guidance_scale`, `num_inference_steps`, optionally `negative_prompt`, `seed`, `model`.
  - Wan2.1 14b: `prompt`, `resolution` (e.g. "832*480"), `guidance_scale`, `sample_shift`, `seed`, `negative_prompt` (see model schema for details).

## Usage
- Use online: https://magicgoddess.github.io/chutes-img-ui
- Or serve locally from the project root:
  - `npm run dev`
  - Open `http://localhost:5173`
- Paste your API key, select a mode, write a prompt, and Generate.

## Image History System

The app automatically saves every generated image with complete metadata to your browser's localStorage:
8. From the Result panel, click "Send to Image Edit" and verify the generated image appears as the source thumbnail and Auto resolution computes from it
9. From Image History, open an image modal and click "Send to Image Edit"; verify the same behavior

### Features
- **Automatic Saving**: Every generated image is saved with settings, timestamp, and source image (for edits)
- **Visual Grid**: Browse all images in a responsive gallery with model and date information
- **One-Click Restore**: Click any image to load its exact settings into the generation form
- **Full Preview Modal**: View images at full size with complete metadata
- **Bulk Management**: Select multiple images for batch operations
- **Smart Storage**: Automatically manages storage by keeping the latest 50 images

### Modal Actions
When viewing an image in full-screen mode:
- **üì• Download Image**: Save the generated image to your device
- **üì• Download Source**: Save the original source image (for image edits only)
- **‚öôÔ∏è Load Settings**: Restore all generation settings to create variations
- **üóëÔ∏è Delete**: Permanently remove the image from history

### Privacy & Storage
- All images and settings are stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers except during generation
- Clear history anytime with the "Clear All" button
- Data persists across browser sessions

## Development & Deployment

### Cache Busting
To ensure users always get the latest version after updates:

```bash
# Update version numbers before deploying
node update-cache-version.js
```

This automatically updates cache versions in the service worker and adds version parameters to CSS/JS files, preventing browser caching issues.

See `CACHE-BUSTING.md` for detailed information about the cache management system.

## Files
- `index.html` ‚Äî markup only
- `app.css` ‚Äî styles
- `js/` ‚Äî modular JavaScript files (main.js, models.js, ui.js, api.js, etc.)
- `manifest.webmanifest` ‚Äî PWA manifest
- `service-worker.js` ‚Äî app-shell caching (skips caching any `*.chutes.ai` request)

## Notes
- Width/height snap to multiples of 64 in [128, 2048].
- Optional fields are omitted from the payload when empty.
- The app is intentionally vibecoded: compact, pragmatic, and focused on getting you from prompt to pixels fast.
