# Chutes Image UI

A minimalist, vibecoded Progressive Web App for generating and editing images with Chutes. Runs fully client-side in your browser; only your selected source image or prompt is sent to Chutes, and your API key is stored in localStorage.

## Features
- Clean single-page UI; desktop two-column layout (Input | Result)
- Supports three modes: Image Edit, Text-to-Image, and Video Generation (Text-to-Video / Image-to-Video)
- Model selector for Text-to-Image and Video Generation (e.g., Hidream, JuggernautXL, Chroma, Wan2.1 14b; Wan2.1 14b Video, Skyreels)
- Smart parameter management:
  - Auto resolution preset; empty fields use model defaults; settings preserved when switching models
  - Models with fixed resolution enums (e.g., Wan2.1 14b image and video) handled via dropdown
  - In Video mode, width/height are reflected from the preset and kept read-only
  - For Wan Video Image-to-Video, resolution is not applicable and the UI hides it automatically
- Generation History: Automatically saves generated images and videos with metadata
  - Collapsible Activity Log
  - Grid view with model and settings preview; videos show a captured first-frame thumbnail
  - Modal preview: images show full-size; videos play inline with controls
  - Settings restoration for images; bulk select/delete; smart storage (keeps last 50)
- Quota counter: Displays remaining quota and usage
- Experimental PWA: installable, offline app-shell cache
- Activity log for quick debugging and status
- Download/copy output (video download, image copy to clipboard)
- Pure static files (no server code)

## Configure
- Chutes API key is stored in `localStorage['chutes_api_key']`.
- Quota usage endpoint: `GET https://api.chutes.ai/users/me/quota_usage/me`
- API endpoints:
  - Image Edit: `POST https://chutes-qwen-image-edit.chutes.ai/generate`
  - Text-to-Image: `POST https://image.chutes.ai/generate` with `model` parameter
  - Wan2.1 14b (Image): `POST https://chutes-wan2-1-14b.chutes.ai/text2image` (uses `resolution` enum, not width/height)
  - Wan2.1 14b Video:
    - Text-to-Video: `POST https://chutes-wan2-1-14b.chutes.ai/text2video`
    - Image-to-Video: `POST https://chutes-wan2-1-14b.chutes.ai/image2video`
  - Skyreels Video:
    - Text-to-Video: `POST https://chutes-skyreels.chutes.ai/generate`
    - Image-to-Video: `POST https://chutes-skyreels.chutes.ai/animate`
- Request body (flat):
  - Image Edit: `width`, `height`, `prompt`, `image_b64`, `true_cfg_scale`, `num_inference_steps`, optionally `negative_prompt`, `seed`.
  - **Send to Image Edit**: One-click button on result and in modal to use an image as the source for Image Edit
  - Text-to-Image: `width`, `height`, `prompt`, `guidance_scale`, `num_inference_steps`, optionally `negative_prompt`, `seed`, `model`.
  - Wan2.1 14b (Image): `prompt`, `resolution` (e.g. "832*480"), `guidance_scale`, `sample_shift`, `seed`, `negative_prompt`.
  - Video (flat JSON, returns mp4 Blob):
    - Wan2.1 14b Video ‚Äì Text-to-Video: `prompt`, `resolution` (e.g. "832*480"), `guidance_scale`, `steps`, `fps`, `frames`, `seed`, optional `sample_shift`, `single_frame`, optional `negative_prompt`.
    - Wan2.1 14b Video ‚Äì Image-to-Video: same fields as above but without `resolution`; include `image_b64` for the source image.
    - Skyreels ‚Äì Text-to-Video: `prompt`, `resolution` (e.g. "544x960"), `guidance_scale`, `seed`, optional `negative_prompt`.
    - Skyreels ‚Äì Image-to-Video: same as above plus `image_b64`.

  Notes:
  - Resolution strings are model-specific: Wan uses `W*H`, Skyreels uses `WxH`. The app formats and includes/omits `resolution` automatically based on each model‚Äôs metadata.

## Usage
- Use online: https://magicgoddess.github.io/chutes-img-ui
- Or serve locally from the project root:
  - `npm run dev`
  - Open `http://localhost:5173`
- Paste your API key, select a mode, write a prompt, and Generate.
- For Video Generation:
  - Pick a video model (Wan 2.1 14b Video or Skyreels)
  - Choose sub-mode: Text-to-Video or Image-to-Video (upload a source image for i2v)
  - Use presets for resolution (Auto reflects model defaults; for Wan i2v, resolution is hidden)
  - Adjust FPS/Frames/Steps/CFG as needed and Generate

## Generation History System

The app automatically saves every generated image and video with complete metadata to your browser (IndexedDB + localStorage snapshot):
8. From the Result panel, click "Send to Image Edit" and verify the generated image appears as the source thumbnail and Auto resolution computes from it
9. From Image History, open an image modal and click "Send to Image Edit"; verify the same behavior

### Features
- **Automatic Saving**: Every generated image/video is saved with settings, timestamp, and source image (for edits/i2v)
- **Visual Grid**: Browse all content in a responsive gallery with model and date information; videos display a first-frame thumbnail
- **One-Click Restore**: Click any image to load its exact settings into the generation form (video settings restoration is not yet supported)
- **Full Preview Modal**: View images full-size; videos play inline with controls and "Download Video"
- **Bulk Management**: Select multiple images for batch operations
- **Smart Storage**: Automatically manages storage by keeping the latest 50 images

### Modal Actions
When viewing content in full-screen mode:
- Images:
  - **üì• Download Image**: Save the generated image to your device
  - **üì• Download Source**: Save the original source image (for image edits only)
  - **‚öôÔ∏è Load Settings**: Restore all generation settings to create variations
  - **üóëÔ∏è Delete**: Permanently remove the image from history
- Videos:
  - **üì• Download Video**: Save the generated video (.mp4)
  - "Send to Image Edit" is not shown for videos

### Privacy & Storage
- All images/videos and settings are stored locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers except during generation
- Clear history anytime with the "Clear All" button
- Data persists across browser sessions

## Development & Deployment

### Cache Busting
To ensure users always get the latest version after updates:

```bash
# Update version numbers before deploying
node update-cache-version.js
```

This automatically updates cache versions in the service worker and adds version parameters to CSS/JS files, preventing browser caching issues.

See `CACHE-BUSTING.md` for detailed information about the cache management system.

## Files
- `index.html` ‚Äî markup only
- `app.css` ‚Äî styles
- `js/` ‚Äî modular JavaScript files (main.js, models.js, ui.js, api.js, etc.)
- `manifest.webmanifest` ‚Äî PWA manifest
- `service-worker.js` ‚Äî app-shell caching (skips caching any `*.chutes.ai` request)

## Notes
- Width/height snap to multiples of 64 in [128, 2048].
- Optional fields are omitted from the payload when empty.
- The app is intentionally vibecoded: compact, pragmatic, and focused on getting you from prompt to pixels fast.
